#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
âœ¨ I am a seasoned software engineer with over 16 years of work experience. I primarily work with the Java/Spring/Kotlin stack. I also possess experience in developing cloud-native applications leveraging Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS. Additionally, I have expertise in front-end development using JS/TS/React. Moreover, I hold a strong interest in software security concepts and have worked extensively with OAuth2 and PKI for several years.
âœ¨ For the past 11 years, I have served as a Senior Software Engineer across 4 companies. I have experience working with various software architectures, including microservices, monolithic, and modular-monolithic. I actively mentor and participate in pair-programming with other engineers as part of Scrum and SAFe teams.
âœ¨ I enjoy working with enterprise applications, open-source projects, and exploring new technologies. I have ventured into new languages and tools like Python and Flutter to push myself beyond my comfort zone.ðŸš€ðŸš€
